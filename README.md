# Little Engine

Built on SFML v2.5 and written in C++, Little Engine is a hobby project with little defined ambition or scope; in other words, let's see where we can take this! 

In the very least, it is desired for the engine to be capable of the following:
1. Have a custom 2D coordinate system [Complete]
2. Have both fixed and variable time step update calls [Complete]
3. Load an arbitrary level at runtime [Complete]
4. Specify a game object's position and orientation in said coordinate space [Complete]
5. Render a game object on screen based on various renderables [Complete]
6. Create dynamic game objects (on the heap) [Complete]
7. Add user created components to game objects at run time [Complete]
8. Have a collision detection and resolution system [Pending]
9. Play sounds [Pending]
10. Play seamless music [Pending]

## Requirements

### To Run [Release pending]
1. Microsoft VC++ Runtime

### To Build Source
1. Microsoft Visual Studio 15 (2017)
2. Windows 10 SDK

If you would like to use another version of SFML, you'll need to fork and replace the corresponding libraries.
